### TimerOptions NOTES:

This x__project will explore a sampling of options from the Timer functionality set.

This test runs 30 seconds via a Thread.sleep(). All timer functions cease after that time.

### Run Once Only

For when you want to run something once and only once.

Hint: Sometimes a template is a better choice, just so you know. See many other tests in this x__project suite as examples.

### Run Every 3 Seconds

This timer runs an event every 3 seconds

### Wait 20 Seconds

This timer waits 10 seconds before it runs
